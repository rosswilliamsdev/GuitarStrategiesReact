        <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
        <p>
          My mission has always been to develop students into{" "}
          <strong>artists</strong>. It’s my belief that artists inspire their
          communities with not only the work they produce, but{" "}
          <strong>by their very presence</strong>. Because of their training,
          artists have an enriched experience of life, seeing connections and
          beauty where others do not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The presence of artists <strong>profoundly</strong> changes the
          trajectory of communities: from <strong>events</strong> and nightlife,
          to the usage and beautification of public spaces, to{" "}
          <strong>dialogues</strong> about a community’s present and future.
          Whether it be through songwriting or as an instrumentalist, I
          challenge my students to <strong>engage</strong> with their worlds
          open heartedly and fully express their experiences through music.
